<p>To the One Who Holds My Heart Angel, </p>

<p>In a world of endless faces, yours is the one that I cannot look away from. <p>
You walk like poetry in motion, and my heart stumbles with every step you take. <p>
I find myself captivated by the brilliance in your smile, as though the sun envies the light you carry within. </p>

<p> Every time you speak, it’s as if the universe quiets down to hear the music of your voice. <p>
Your laughter lingers in my mind like the sweetest melody, replaying in moments when I need it the most. <p>
I can’t help but wonder, do you know the magic you leave behind wherever you go?  </p>

<p>You are the kind of rare beauty that artists dream of capturing and poets struggle to describe. <p>
But it’s not just your grace that has me undone; <p>
it’s the kindness in your eyes, the strength in your spirit, and the way you make the ordinary feel extraordinary. </p>

<p> If only you could feel what my heart whispers every time I see you. <p>
It dreams of a world where you and I share sunsets, secrets, and something unshakable. <p>
It longs to give you a love so steadfast, it could weather every storm.  </p>

<p>You are my favorite thought, my sweetest daydream, my unspoken prayer. <p>
If you take my hand, I promise to spend my life making sure you never doubt how cherished you truly are.  </p>

<p>Yours, always hoping, </p>
